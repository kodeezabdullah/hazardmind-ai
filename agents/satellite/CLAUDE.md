# Satellite Agent

Processes Copernicus/Sentinel satellite imagery for disaster zones.

## Responsibilities
- Fetch satellite imagery for given bbox
- Detect affected area and land cover
- Upload processed imagery to Cloudflare R2
- Publish results via Band SDK

## Band Integration

Connects to the Band platform using the Anthropic adapter.

- **Package:** `band-sdk[anthropic]` (installed as `band-sdk`, imported as `band`).
  The public docs reference `thenvoi`; this project uses `band` v1.0.0.
- **Import:** `from band import Agent`,
  `from band.adapters.anthropic import AnthropicAdapter`
- **Connect:** `Agent.create(adapter=..., agent_id=..., api_key=..., ws_url=..., rest_url=...)`
  then `await agent.start()` (opens WebSocket, fetches metadata), and
  `await agent.stop()` to disconnect. Use `await agent.run()` for a long-lived agent.
- **Credentials:** `agent_config.yaml` (gitignored) holds `agent_id`/`api_key`
  under the `satellite_agent` key. Runtime values are loaded from `.env`.

### Required env vars (see `.env.example`)
- `THENVOI_REST_URL` — Band REST URL (`https://app.band.ai/`)
- `THENVOI_WS_URL` — Band WebSocket URL
- `BAND_AGENT_ID` — agent UUID from the Band platform
- `BAND_API_KEY` — agent API key from the Band platform
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — provider key for the Anthropic adapter

### Setup progress
- [x] Install Band SDK (`band-sdk[anthropic]`) and pin in `requirements.txt`
- [x] Add Band env vars to `.env.example`
- [x] Create `agent_config.yaml` (gitignored)
- [x] Add `verify_setup.py` connectivity check
- [x] Register agent on Band platform and fill in real credentials
- [x] Run `verify_setup.py` against live Band to confirm connection (connects as "HazardMind Satellite")
- [ ] Implement imagery processing pipeline (`processor.py`)
- [ ] Wire agent into Band rooms and publish results

## Core Logic

### Step 3: Sentinel selection + Copernicus auth (`sentinel.py`) — DONE

Picks the Sentinel mission for a disaster, authenticates to the Copernicus Data
Space Ecosystem (CDSE), and finds the best scene over a bbox.

- `select_satellite(disaster_type, cloud_cover=None)` — flood → Sentinel-1
  (SAR, weather-independent); earthquake/landslide → Sentinel-2 (optical).
  If `cloud_cover > 30%`, an optical choice is switched to Sentinel-1. Unknown
  disaster types default to optical. Pure logic, no network.
- `authenticate_copernicus()` — password-grant token from the CDSE Keycloak
  endpoint using `COPERNICUS_USERNAME`/`COPERNICUS_PASSWORD` (client_id
  `cdse-public`). Returns the access token, or `None` on missing creds/failure.
- `search_imagery(bbox, satellite_type, date_range=7)` — queries the CDSE OData
  catalogue (`/odata/v1/Products`) intersecting the bbox over the last
  `date_range` days. Sentinel-1: most recent scene. Sentinel-2: filtered to
  cloud cover < 30%, least-cloudy scene wins. Returns the scene metadata dict.

Notes:
- `CLOUD_COVER_THRESHOLD = 30.0` is shared by both selection and the S2 filter.
- Added `requests` to `requirements.txt` (sentinel.py imports it directly;
  boundary.py had relied on it being transitively present).
- All functions log and return `None`/skip on failure rather than raising.
- `python sentinel.py` runs an offline selection demo plus a live auth +
  catalogue smoke test (small Lahore bbox); confirmed working against CDSE.

### Step 2: Boundary fetching (`boundary.py`) — DONE

Fetches administrative boundaries from the Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) API to
drive both the map display and the satellite clip extent.

- `get_region_boundary(location_name)` — region's GeoJSON polygon + bbox
  (faded background on the map). E.g. `"Punjab, Pakistan"` → province boundary.
- `get_risk_city_boundaries(region_name, city_list)` — one boundary per risk
  city (highlighted overlay). Cities are disambiguated by appending the region
  name; unresolved cities are logged and skipped, not fatal.
- `merge_risk_boundaries(city_polygons)` — `shapely.unary_union` of the risk
  cities into a single GeoJSON geometry.
- `get_analysis_bbox(merged_polygon)` — `(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)` of the
  merged geometry; this is the bbox the imagery pipeline clips to.

Strategy: region = faded background, risk cities = highlighted overlay,
satellite clip = merged risk-city bbox only (avoids downloading the whole
region).

Notes:
- Deps (`requests`, `shapely`) were already pinned; no new requirements added.
- Honors Nominatim policy: descriptive User-Agent + ≤1 request/sec (enforced
  by a module-level throttle in `_nominatim_search`).
- All functions return `None` / skip on failure and log via the module logger
  rather than raising, so a single bad city does not abort an analysis.
- `python boundary.py` runs a live smoke test (Punjab + Lahore/Multan). Place
  names can be non-ASCII (Urdu), so the test reconfigures stdout to UTF-8.
